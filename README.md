*	Introduction

Can't find a seat in the library? or can't find a palace to park? Here's our website can help you with, no matter you are student, staff, or just visiting University of Calgary, we can help you to avoid the crowd. How to make these people schedule all these business efficiently in UofC, obviously it is a common problem people will encounter around the campus, and we tried to solve it by spliting it into 4 categories.

*	Why we choose this topic?

	*	Base on our observeration, we found that sometimes people in UofC have a hard time on scheduling before accessing public resource in UofC. For example, when someone plans to access some online information in TFDL, he may have no idea that TFDL is closed or TFDL is full of students since it is the final season. Of course he can search the schedule such as when normally TFDL will open or close, but it is inefficient because when you access UofC websites, you will see the important notice, schedule information of different departments, are **scattered** everywhere. Therefore, in order to make students, staff's lives and visitors to UofC more easiler, we try to **integrate** some simple but useful information for them, such as if the facility is available at this moment(for example, TFDL is closed during public holidays), how many basketball courts are currently occupied in Red Gym.
	
	*	On the another hand, we also noticed that, when students or staff arrive at the campus by cars, it is hard for them to quickly find an empty car slot, so we make an assumption that if UofC has equipped some hardware to detect if a car is parked in carslot in parking lots such as Art Parkade, we can take advantage of it and calculate how many carslots still available before they access car parks, and the figures of different parks can be dynamically shown in our app.

*	What aspects of public resource did we cover in this project?


	*	***STUDY*** We monitor the number of people in each library to determine whether it is too crowded or not, so you can easily avoid the crowd and find another library that is not too crowded to study in.

	*	***LIVING***	We also monitor the number of people in Dining Center, so you can avoid the crowd and enjoy you meal quietly.

	*	***EXERCISE***	We fetch each gym or swimming pool's schedule from university active living website, and show the schedule and that status of the gym.

	*	***PARKING*** You must experienced the situation when you are late for class or exam, and you can't find a empty parking space in the parking lot, to avoid this, we monitor the number of empty parking space in each parking lot around campus, go to our website have a look, and 'no parking space' is never going to be your problem again.

In a word, our project is designed for student to view school's facility, which includes four directions which are study, living, entertainment and parking.
